# VRC-Shaders
Various Shaders for Vrchat written mostly originally for my friend's projects.

## 2D Hologram
The 2D hologram shader is a simple unlit shader that creates a hologram effect with a slick distance based fade effect written originally for [Ostinyo](https://vrchat.com/home/user/usr_b231cc91-30ea-4181-8ae6-d7dd85794120).
